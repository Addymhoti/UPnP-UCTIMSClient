<!-- DTD for VoD listings

This is based largely on the xmltv stuff with added elements for 
extra information we may need and with some of the non relevant stuff
stripped out.
-->

<!-- Root element

The root element is vod and may contain with in its tags series and video.

The attribute stuff is taken from xmltv DTD:

Date should be the date when the listings were originally produced in
whatever format; if you're converting data from another source, then
use the date given by that source.  The date when the conversion
itself was done is not important.

To indicate the source of the listings, there are three attributes you
can define:

'source-info-url' is a URL describing the data source in
some human-readable form.  So if you are getting your listings from
SAT.1, you might set this to the URL of a page explaining how to
subscribe to their feed.  If you are getting them from a website, the
URL might be the index of the site or at least of the TV listings
section.

'source-info-name' is the link text for that URL; it should
generally be the human-readable name of your listings supplier.
Sometimes the link text might be printed without the link itself, in
hardcopy listings for example.

'source-data-url' is where the actual data is grabbed from.  This
should link directly to the machine-readable data files if possible,
but it's not rigorously defined what 'actual data' means.  If you are
parsing the data from human-readable pages, then it's more appropriate
to link to them with the source-info stuff and omit this attribute.

To publicize your wonderful program which generated this file, you can
use 'generator-info-name' (preferably in the form 'progname/version')
and 'generator-info-url' (a link to more info about the program).

<!-- series - Information about the series element

The series element is used as a hanging peg for movie and tvshow elements.
Basically it can be used to indicate that a particular movie or tv show belongs
to a certain series. eg an episode of Friends belongs to the series Friends.

The attributes of the series element are for further information about the series
to facilitate the user and provide them with extra information in the content guide
-->
<!ELEMENT series (display-name+, description*, series-category*) >
<!ATTLIST series id CDATA #REQUIRED >

<!-- A user-friendly name for the tv series. The lang attribute follows RFC 1766.
-->
<!ELEMENT display-name (#PCDATA)>
<!ATTLIST display-name lang CDATA #IMPLIED>

<!-- A description may accompany the series as to provide the user with 
some extra information about it.

As an example the description may contain information about the general theme of the
series, when it was aired and/or critical acclaim.
-->
<!ELEMENT description (#PCDATA)>
<!ATTLIST description lang CDATA #IMPLIED>

<!-- If the series belongs to a general category/s it may be placed here

For example a horror tv series may belong to the categories horror and action.
-->
<!ELEMENT series-category (#PCDATA)>
<!ATTLIST series-category lang CDATA #IMPLIED>

<!-- video - details of a single tvshow episode

Based on the xmltv programme element but with a few sub elements ripped out that don't
really apply to video on demand.

Also the attributes have all be replaced by more relevant ones for VoD.

-->
<!ELEMENT video (title+, secondary-title*, desc*, credits?, date?,
                     category*, language?, orig-language?, length?,
                     icon*, url*, country*, episode-num*, video-properties?, audio?,
                     new?, subtitles*, rating*, star-rating* )>
<!ATTLIST video     type     	CDATA #REQUIRED
                    series      CDATA #IMPLIED >

<!-- Programme title, eg 'Friends'. -->
<!ELEMENT title (#PCDATA)>
<!ATTLIST title lang CDATA #IMPLIED>

<!-- Secondary-title or episode title, eg 'The One With The Sonogram At The End'. -->
<!ELEMENT secondary-title (#PCDATA)>
<!ATTLIST secondary-title lang CDATA #IMPLIED>

<!-- Description of the programme or episode.

Unlike other elements, long bits of whitespace here are treated as
equivalent to a single space and newlines are permitted, so you can
break lines and write a pretty-looking paragraph if you wish.
-->
<!ELEMENT desc (#PCDATA)>
<!ATTLIST desc lang CDATA #IMPLIED>

<!-- Credits for the programme.

People are listed in decreasing order of importance; so for example
the starring actors appear first followed by the smaller parts.  As
with other parts of this file format, not mentioning a particular
actor (for example) does not imply that he _didn't_ star in the film -
so normally you'd list only the few most important people.

Adapter can be either somebody who adapted a work for television, or
somebody who did the translation from another language.  Maybe these
should be separate, but if so how would 'translator' fit in with the
'language' element?

<!-- The date the programme or film was finished.  This will probably
be the same as the copyright date.

<!ATTLIST category lang CDATA #IMPLIED>

<!-- The language the programme will be broadcast in.  This does not
include the language of any subtitles, but it is affected by dubbing
into a different language.  For example, if a French film is dubbed
into English, language=en and orig-language=fr.

There are two ways to specify the language.  You can use the
two-letter codes such as en or fr, or you can give a name such as
'English' or 'Deutsch'.  In the latter case you might want to use the
'lang' attribute, for example

<language lang="fr">Allemand</language>
-->
<!ELEMENT language (#PCDATA)>
<!ATTLIST language lang CDATA #IMPLIED>

<!-- The original language, before dubbing.  The same remarks as for
'language' apply.

<!-- The true length of the programme or runtime.
-->
<!ELEMENT length (#PCDATA)>
<!ATTLIST length units (seconds | minutes | hours) #REQUIRED>

<!-- An icon associated with the element that contains it.
src: uri of image

this will change to be more like HTML's 'img'.

<!-- The value of the element that contains it.  This is for elements
that can have both a textual 'value' and an icon.  At present there is
no 'lang' attribute here because things like 'PG' are not translatable
(although a document explaining what 'PG' actually means would be).
It happens that 'value' is used only for this sort of thing.
-->
<!ELEMENT value (#PCDATA)>

<!-- A country where the programme was made or one of the countries in
a joint production.  You can give the name of a country, in which case
you might want to specify the language in which this name is written,
or you can give a two-letter uppercase country code, in which case the
lang attribute should not be given.  For example,

<country lang="en">Italy</country>
<country>GB</country>
-->
<!ELEMENT country (#PCDATA)>
<!ATTLIST country lang CDATA #IMPLIED>

<!-- Episode number

We use the xmltv_ns here but we have customized it a bit since I don't
quiet agree with the xmltv way and want it to start from season 1 being 1
and not 0 as xmltv does it. This it is easier to parse as not broadcaster 
that I know of uses season 0 instead of season 1.

 It is three numbers separated by dots,
the first is the series or season, the second the episode number
within that series, and the third the part number, if the programme is
part of a two-parter.  All these numbers are indexed from one, and
they can be given in the form 'X/Y' to show series X out of Y series
made, or episode X out of Y episodes in this series, or part X of a
Y-part episode.  If any of these aren't known they can be omitted.
You can put spaces whereever you like to make things easier to read.

Some examples will make things clearer.  The first episode of the
second series is '2.1.0/2' .  If it were a two-part episode, then the
first half would be '2.1.1/2' and the second half '2.1.2/2'.  If you
know that an episode is from the first season, but you don't know
which episode it is or whether it is part of a multiparter, you could
give the episode-num as '0..'.  

Not sure if the following still applies with edited system.
Here the second and third numbers have been omitted.  
If you know that this is the first part of a three-part
episode, which is the last episode of the first series of thirteen,
its number would be '0 . 12/13 . 0/3'.  The series number is just '0'
because you don't know how many series there are in total - perhaps
the show is still being made!
-->
<!ELEMENT episode-num (#PCDATA)>

<!-- Video details: the subelements describe the picture quality as
follows:

present: whether this programme has a picture (no, in the
case of radio stations broadcast on TV or 'Blue'), legal values are
'yes' or 'no'.  Obviously if the value is 'no', the other elements are
meaningless.

colour: 'yes' for colour, 'no' for black-and-white.

aspect: The horizontal:vertical aspect ratio, eg '4:3' or '16:9'.

quality: information on the quality, eg 'HDTV', '800x600'.

<!-- Audio details, similar to video details above.

present: whether this programme has any sound at all, 'yes' or 'no'.

stereo: Description of the stereo-ness of the sound.  Legal values
are currently 'mono','stereo','dolby','dolby digital' and 'surround'; 
others like 'quad' might be added later.
-->
<!ELEMENT audio (present?, stereo?)>
<!ELEMENT stereo (#PCDATA)>

<!-- New.  This is the first time the video has been listed.

Note that this does not mean 'new season' or 'new episode' of an
existing show.  You can express part of that using the episode-num
stuff.
-->
<!ELEMENT new EMPTY>

<!-- Subtitles.  These can be either 'teletext' (sent digitally, and
displayed at the viewer's request), 'onscreen' (superimposed on the
picture and impossible to get rid of), or 'deaf-signed' (in-vision 
signing for users of sign language). You can have multiple subtitle
streams to handle different languages.  Language for subtitles is
specified in the same way as for programmes.
-->
<!ELEMENT subtitles (language?)>
<!ATTLIST subtitles type (teletext | onscreen | deaf-signed) #IMPLIED>

<!-- Rating.  Various bodies decide on classifications for films -
usually a minimum age you must be to see it.  In principle the same
could be done for ordinary TV programmes.  Because there are many
systems for doing this, you can also specify the rating system used
(which in practice is the same as the body which made the rating).
-->
<!ELEMENT rating (value, icon*)>
<!ATTLIST rating system CDATA #IMPLIED>

<!-- 'Star rating' - many listings guides award a programme a score as
a quick guide to how good it is.  The value of this element should be
'N / M', for example one star out of a possible five stars would be
'1 / 5'.  Zero stars is also a possible score (and not the same as
'unrated').  You should try to map whatever wacky system your listings
source uses to a number of stars: so for example if they have thumbs
up, thumbs sideways and thumbs down, you could map that to two, one or
zero stars out of two.  If a programme is marked as recommended in a
listings guide you could map this to '1 / 1'. Because there could be many 
ways to provide star-ratings or recommendations for a programme, you can 
specify multiple star-ratings. You can specify the star-rating system 
used, or the provider of the recommendation, with the system attribute. 
Whitespace between the numbers and slash is ignored.
-->

<!ELEMENT star-rating (value, icon*)>
<!ATTLIST star-rating system CDATA #IMPLIED>
<!-- (Why are things like 'stereo', which must be one of a small
number of values, stored as the contents of elements rather than as
attributes?  Because they are data rather than metadata.  Attributes
are used for things like the language or encoding of element contents,
or for programme transmission details.) -->
