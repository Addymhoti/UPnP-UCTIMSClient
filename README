2012 - old libvlc functions rewritten to use newer version of libvlc library (1.1.12) by Roman Bronis <roman.bronis@gmail.com> Slovak University of Technology - FIIT
For more information see CHANGES.


Troubleshooting:
---------------

Libraries:

All of the required libraries can be found in the standard Ubuntu Feisty (7.04) repositories.

If you install the libraries manually the client may not find them and this error may occur:

	error while loading shared libraries: libortp.so.5

Try typing
	
	export LD_LIBRARY_PATH="/usr/local/lib"

----

Registering:

There are some bugs with the reg event (either in the core or the client).

If you get the warning:

	Warning: Subscription to reg event failed

Try deregistering and register again.

183 Session Progress

If you don't want 183 session progress or UPDATE messages set your QoS to none.

If you want to change the way the client responds to messages, dig around in ims_exosip_event_handler.c
